    /* cvCreateHist function is used to create the histograms. Following is the explanation of the various arguments of the function

    1. First argument: Defines how many dimensions the histogram will have. To keep things simple this tutorial only uses one dimensional histograms.
038
    2. Second argument: Defines the size of the dimensions. If we were using higher dimensional histograms we would have to pass an array of sizes, one for each dimension, but we are only using one dimension so the array we pass only has one value in it. We choose to make the size of the dimension 256 because the depth of the images we are working with is 8 bit, meaning that we will get one bin for each intensity level. We could have chosen to have less bins but the histogram would have less resolution. We could have chosen more bins but we would not show any more information.
039
    3. Third argument: Tells OpenCV how to store the data in the histogram. There are two options for this: CV_HIST_ARRAY and CV_HIST_SPARSE. The second option is useful for storing multidimensional histograms that will have most of their bins with counts of zero. Since we are using a one dimensional histogram, we donâ€™t expect sparse data so we choose the first option.
040
    4. Fourth argument: Used to specify the range of values for each dimension.  Each range is stored as an array of two values, the minimum and maximum value for that dimension. Again we are using one dimension so it looks a bit redundant to make an array of arrays, but only with one array. We have to do this though, because this fourth argument expects an array to 2 value arrays. It is important to know how OpenCV creates the bins based on the range values and the histogram size. OpenCV will take the value supplied in ranges and break it into as many sub intervals as defined in hist_size.
041
    5. Fifth argument: Defines if the sub intervals are to be split uniformly or not. For this case we definitely want each bin to be the same width as the others so we choose this argument to be 1.

This function is made for getting values out of a one dimensional histogram. Its arguments are the histogram you want to look into, and the bin number you want to see.

This allows the user to select which channel or combination of channels that they want to see. The next step is the scaling. The function cvScale is used. Its first argument is the source to be scaled and the second is the destination for result. Here we used the same place for source and destination meaning that the bins are scaled and then stored back in the same place. The last argument is the scale factor. A factor of 438/max_value was used because the highest bar that we want to draw is 438 pixels high (so it does not go out of the bounds of the picture we used for the axis). Inside the for loop we see a complicated line of code that draws all the rectangles. The function cvRectangle is used for this. It requires that we pass it which image to draw on, two points to define the rectangles, the colour and line thickness. We specify line thickness as -1 which means a filled rectangle. The last function used is cvAdd which is used to simplify drawind the multiple histograms with overlap. By adding colours on top of each other no extar code is required to deal with the overlap.*/
